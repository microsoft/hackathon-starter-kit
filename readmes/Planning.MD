# Planning

### Planning is key for a successful hackathon from securing a sponsor to setting the dates and judging criteria.

Different types of hackathons:

- [Internal Hackathon](../internal-hack/README.md)
- [External Hackathon](../community-hack/README.md)

> There are few key planning differences between these two types of hackathons. Write up coming soon!  

To ensure a successful hackathon, consider the following big picture questions:
 
	What is the purpose of this hackathon? (or what do you want to accomplish with this hackathon?)
	What are the problem types/categories that the hack is expected to address?
	What does success look like?
	Does the success require follow-up activity post event?
	What will the post hackathon experience look like? (Mentorship? code-with? Etc.)
	What is the timeline of the hackathon? (When? How many days?)
	What is the Hackathon Budget? (Virtual: Most of the budget will go into collaboration tool and lab environment)


## Assemble your team

Gathering the right people early is crucial!

*Decide on a single communication channel*. This will help everything (resources, and chats) be in one place. 

### Organizing Committee

Executive sponsors and Champions
- Securing an executive sponshorship, buy in and support is vital to the credibility of the hackathon. 
- Executive sponsorship can be at different levels, from lending their ‘name’ as sponsor to being involved in challenges, to 
participating actively in hacking events.
- Champions "raving fans" can naturally connect with people and share their experience with hackathon.


### Project Manager
- PMs help keeping track of the progress and putting pressure on people as needed
	
### IT Team
- Setting up  platform, website, registration, technical support
	
### Marketing Team
- Communications and outreach, Content creation for targeted messaging
	
### Legal Team
- For Data Privacy and Intellectual Property (IP). As well as sending out Prizes

### Coaching / SME Team
- You want to have enough staff who are present/rotating between the teams. Subject Matter Experts can provide additional sessions that will help with the purpose of the hackathon (mainly industry expert and design-thinking expert)

## Problem Statements

Without a problem to address, or categorical area of focus, participants in a hackathon are likely to spend too much time trying to determine a path and may ultimately not provide value to the intended goal of the event. For this reason it is important to define the problem statement, and or areas of focus ahead of time.


Keep in mind that even if you do ask the participants to bring their own problem statements (which is completely fine), it's helpful to provide problem types or categories to help keep the event focused. Remember, hackathons generally have a constrained amount of time. One of the most difficult components of that aspect is balancing specific direction and ideation of the partipants.

### Providing your own problem statement
- You can divide these statements into different tracks/topics. eg. 4 tracks with one of the tracks being Open ("Create your own journey"). This will help attract diverse participants.


## Runway time

Knowing how long it takes to prepare for the hackathon is important. These are some of the questions to think about when you run an external hackathon

	How long will it take to set up a collaboration tool and the lab environment?
	How long will it take to get the budget?
	How long will the registration be opened for? When will it close?
	How long will it take to collaborate with the legal team? 
	How long will it take for marketing resources to be available?
