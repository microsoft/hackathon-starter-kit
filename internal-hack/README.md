# Internal Hackathon
This page is designed to provide guidance and ideas to help organizations run Internal Hackathon.

## Steps to run a Internal Hackathon

#### 1. Determine Name, Purpose and Outcomes of the Hackathon
For a start, deciding on what you want to achieve from running a hackathon is important. A well-run internal hackathon is great for team building and cross-disciplinary collaboration, as youâ€™ll be able to encourage people to work outside of their regular cliques.
For example, every team has to include members from different functions (Engineering/Product/Design, Marketing, Sales, and Customer Support & Success) or different skill levels to ensure a mix of talents and experience in every group.

#### 2. Get everyone involved even before the event

With all of our hackathons, we see the following common activities and internal hackathons are no different:
Form Teams
- How are you going to identify participants?
-   Are a segment of people just required to participate? This is common with internal hackathons where hacking on an idea is just part of the job responsibilities.
-   Do people need to self-register?
-   What information do you need to collect?
- How are you going to assemble HACKATHON TEAMS?
-   Pre-existing Teams - you could just allow people to sign up in the teams they are already in.
-   Assigned with Intent - you could assign members to HACKATHON TEAMS based on certain criteria. For instance, you may want to ensure each team has a balanced set of skills or intentionally mix up people from different teams or geographies in order to foster future collaboration.
-   Assigned Randomly - you could always just assign people randomly or build teams in the order in which individuals register.
-   Organic / Self-forming

Ideate!
- HACKATHON TEAMS need time to come together on what they will build as a team. Every hackathon is different and yet we encourage each team to:
-   Create a backlog of Epic(s). What are the "big rock" problems the team wants to tackle? We find it helpful to encourage prioritization of Epic(s) as the team lists them. The idea 
-   Create a backlog of User Stories under each Epic(s). We encourage User Stories in the form of "As a [persona], I want to [take action] so [the why]." This level of detail is needed to understand what specifically the team hopes to work on in the Build phase and hopefully present in the Share phase. If the team is struggling to create User Stories under an Epic, do they not understand the problem well enough?
- TIP! Some teams struggle timeboxing ideation. They may be used to old-school waterfall projects that try to think through and collect every requirement upfront - and this approach won't work in hackathon. You will likely need coaches that help teams timebox ideation to something reasonable and how to build a prioritized backlog.

Build!
- This is the phase of the project where the HACKATHON TEAM assembles the desired deliverable of the event. In most hackathons, we are working towards some kind of working prototype or MVP.

Share!
- We believe this is a critical phase in a hackathon. This is where the HACKATHON TEAM presents the work they've done during the event. This is an opportunity for them to show off what they learned and be proud of their solution.
- Recognition & Prizes This is likely where one or more HACKATHON TEAMS are recognized for their work. For many hackathon participants, the opportunity to learn and collaborate with others is incentive enough to participate. Some hackathons need more incentive to attract their target audience (often developers) to contribute their time and expertise. Internal hackathon organizers may offer charitable donations in the name of the team, days off work, cash awards, or more creative prizes.
