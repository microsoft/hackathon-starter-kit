# Planning
### Planning is key for a successful hackathon from securing a sponsor to setting the dates and judging criteria.

To ensure a successful hackathon, consider the following big picture questions:
 
	What is the purpose of this hackathon? OR what do you want to accomplish with this hackathon?
	What are the problem types/categories that the hack is expected to address?
	What does success look like?
	Does the success require follow-up activity post event?
	What will the post hackathon experience?
	What is the timeline of the hackathon? (When and how long)
	what is the Hackathon Budget?

#### Assemble your team

Organizing Committee


Sponsors and champions

Securing an executive sponshorship, buy in and support is vital to the credibility of the hackathon. Executive sponsorship can 
be at different levels, from lending their ‘name’ as sponsor to being involved in challenges, to 
participating actively in hacking events.
Champions "raving fans" can naturally connect with people and share their experience with hackathon.
