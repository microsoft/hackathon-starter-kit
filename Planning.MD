# Planning
## Planning is key for a successful hackathon from securing a sponsor to setting the dates and judging criteria.

To ensure a successful hackathon, consider the following big picture questions:
 
	What is the purpose of this hackathon? OR what do you want to accomplish with this hackathon?
	What are the problem types/categories that the hack is expected to address?
	What does success look like?
	Does the success require follow-up activity post event?
	What will the post hackathon experience?
	What is the timeline of the hackathon? (When and how long)
  what is the Hackathon Budget?
