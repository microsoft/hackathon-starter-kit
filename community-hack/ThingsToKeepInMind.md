# Gotchas

## How is the hackathon being held?
(note: These notes are from the organizer's perspective)

### In-Person
Pros:

- Not much pre-training required to fill the tech illiteracy. 
- Natural collaborative atmosphere (The room will be filled with hackers and the energy you get from the environment and people can't really compare to virtual events)
- Allows participants to new people outside of their hacking group. 
- Travel

Cons:

- Finding event space
- Cost (infra, meals, staff, travel)


### Virtual

Pros:

- "**Free**" (for the most parts)
- Low barrier to entry. Organizers can try to invite anyone from anywhere.

Cons:

- Tech literacy (at least for the softwares the event will be leveraging) need to be addressed before hand with trainings.
- **Low commitment rate**
  - We've seen people bail out at the last minute and saw teams having to scramble to find people with the right skills
- Needing to emphasize on collabrative atmosphere (*such as turning the video on. Allowing each other to speak and take turns sharing their screen*)
- Requiring Consent from participants for recorded contents


### Hybrid

Pros:

- Similar to in-person

Cons:

- Timezones between in-person and virtual attendees.
- Effort to make sure the hackathon experience is engaging for both groups.

## Incentives

**Prizes**? **Rounds across multiple hackathons**? **For learning**? **Career Building**?

These are some of the questions you should consider when hosting a hackathon. This might determine which sort of participants you can expect.
