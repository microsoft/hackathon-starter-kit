# How to run a Virtual Community Hackathon

Community hackathon means a company is partnering with other external organizing parties.

## Goal
**Know the why.** This will help determine your agenda and specific activities (types of trainings and speaking sessions) "pre-hackathon"

> pre-hackathon is just a suggestion but from what we've seen, extra sessions during the actual hacking time distracts them from their flow

## Marketing
How will you collaborate with the marketing team? 


## Environment
If you are providing the environment were would you host your environment?
Collaboration tool?
Development environment? (Azure, PowerApps.. etc)


## Technical 
Will you be creating teams? How and when will the teams be formed? Prior to the hackathon or during the hackathon?

> If you are using MS Teams we have created a custom Team Builder app you can use 

Will you want to gamify your hackathon?
